### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rohit. 

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Analytics and bring 2 years of hands-on experience in the end-to-end data lifecycle. I enjoy tackling large, complex datasets and applying my problem-solving mindset. My focus is on transforming raw data into actionable insights and building predictive models that support data-driven decision-making.

Python is my go-to language for data processing, automation, and machine learning, with a solid foundation in R and C++. I am proficient in SQL for database querying, Excel for analysis and reporting, and Power BI as well as Tableau for building interactive dashboards. I also bring expertise in cloud platforms such as Azure and AWS for designing pipelines and managing data workflows.  

My professional journey has been rooted in data-centric roles. At JuntoAI, I contributed to an AI-powered networking platform during the Irish National AI Challenge 2025. At Seagull Enterprises, I led ERP data migration using Python and developed business intelligence solutions for SME clients with Power BI. Earlier, at Hugg.co.in, I applied SQL, Python, and Excel to real-world research and analytics projects, laying the groundwork for my career in data and technology.
