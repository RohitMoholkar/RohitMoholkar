### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rohit. 

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Analytics and bring 2 years of hands-on experience in the end-to-end data lifecycle. I enjoy tackling large, complex datasets and applying my problem-solving mindset. My focus is on transforming raw data into actionable insights and building predictive models that support data-driven decision-making.

Python is my go-to language for data processing, automation, and machine learning. I am proficient in SQL for database querying, Excel for analysis and reporting, and Power BI for building interactive dashboards. I also bring expertise in cloud platforms such as Azure and AWS for designing pipelines and managing data workflows.  

I'm a recent graduate with a Master's in Data Analytics, currently based in Dublin, Ireland. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. I am passionate about coding, particularly in Python, and my expertise lies in data analytics and machine learning, focusing on extracting actionable insights and developing predictive models. In my role as an Associate Analyst at Hugg.co.in, I gained practical experience applying analytical techniques to enhance decision-making. You can explore my individual and academic projects on GitHub, where I apply my skills to solve real-world challenges and pursue data-driven opportunities.
